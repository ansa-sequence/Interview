* https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time/

## Pattern: Cyclic Sort

See https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/discuss/859510/C%2B%2B-O(N)-O(1)-using-Cyclic-Sort for how grokking the coding interview approached these problems. It uses the fact that we can sort the array in O(n) without comparison operators

## Pattern: Modified Binary Search

* Did not find. Problem is find index of smallest element greater or equal to input value
* https://leetcode.com/problems/find-smallest-letter-greater-than-target/

* https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-covering-elements-from-k-lists/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-pairs-with-smallest-sums/ small difference, grokking has different sort order and wants the largest

## Pattern: 0/1 Knapsack

* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/RM1BDv71V60
* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/3jEPRo5PDvx or https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/
* https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-dynamic-programming-patterns-for-coding-interviews/3j64vRY6JnR
* https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/ similar concept, but problem description is more abstract.
* https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/ similar, but return the number of combinations instead of the combinations
* https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/
* BONUS : Not in grokking, but I still found this very useful https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/

## Pattern: Topological Sort

* First problem is identical to the following three
* https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-ii/ 
* Same as above, but return all instead of any
* https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/sequence-reconstruction/description/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/
